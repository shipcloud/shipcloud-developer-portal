  Shipments with Pickup Requests
</h4>

<p>
  If you don't have regular pickups by TNT you will have to request pickups by the carrier. In
  contrast to other carriers we support, pickup requests for TNT have to be done a little
  differently. When creating a shipment for TNT a pickup request has to be made at the same time.
  Therefore you can add a pickup element when creating your shipment request.
