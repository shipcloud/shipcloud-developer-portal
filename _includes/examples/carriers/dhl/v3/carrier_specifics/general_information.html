  Streetname &amp; housenumber
</h5>

<p>
  Although the DHL webservice required a housenumber to be provided as a separate attribute
  (<code>street_no</code>) in the past, they are now making it possible to provide streetname and
  housenumber in one attribute. So you can specify an address by only transmitting the
  <code>street</code> attribute, containing both values.

  <strong>Notice:</strong> Since DHL has a separate returns webservice, this is only applicable for
  outbound shipments and not for returns. There you still have to provide both entries when creating
  a shipping label.
