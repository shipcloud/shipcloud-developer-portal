  Streetname &amp; housenumber
</h5>

<p>
  Although the DHL webservice required a housenumber to be provided as a separate attribute
  (<code>street_no</code>) in the past, they are now making it possible to provide streetname and
  housenumber in one attribute. So you can specify an address by only transmitting the
  <code>street</code> attribute, containing both values.

  Besides our normal offering of connecting you to the DHL webservices, we can also provide you
  with an IDE solution. Please <a href="mailto:sales@shipcloud.io">contact our sales team</a> if
  this is something you would like to use.
