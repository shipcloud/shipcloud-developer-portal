  General information
</h4>

<h5 id="v3---streetname-and-housenumber" class="text-blue">
  Streetname &amp; housenumber
</h5>

<p>
  Although the DHL webservice required a housenumber to be provided as a separate attribute
  (<code>street_no</code>) in the past, they are now making it possible to provide streetname and
  housenumber in one attribute. So you can specify an address by only transmitting the
  <code>street</code> attribute, containing both values. This is also applicable for shipments to a
  <a href="#v3---packstation">Packstation</a> or <a href="#v3---postfiliale">Postfiliale</a>.
</p>

<p class="mt-m">
  <strong>Notice:</strong> Since DHL has a separate returns webservice, this is only applicable for
  outbound shipments and not for returns. There you still have to provide both entries when creating
  a shipping label.

<h5 id="v3---additional-delivery-details" class="text-blue mt-m">
  Additional delivery details in tracking events
</h5>

<p>
  Sometimes DHL provides additional information regarding a delivery that has been made. For example
  when the shipments has been handed over to a next door neighbor or has been placed at a drop off
  location. In those cases we're returning these additional delivery details as part of the
  corresponding tracking event.
