  Street and house number
</h4>
<p>
  In the early days, providing the street name and the house number in separate attributes was
  mandatory when creating a shipping label. You can now provide both entries in the
  <code>street</code> attribute, making it easier for your the API client, since you do not have to
  provide both entries separately anymore.

  <strong>Notice:</strong> Since DHL has a separate returns webservice, this is only applicable for
  outbound shipments and not for returns. There you still have to provide both entries when creating
  a shipping label.
