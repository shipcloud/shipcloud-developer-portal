    We've written a shipcloud wrapper for the ruby language that you can use for integrating
    shipcloud into your own ruby projects. Just head over to our
    <a href="https://github.com/shipcloud/shipcloud-ruby">Github repository</a>, clone it and off
    you go!

  <p>
    Why reinvent the wheel? There are already a lot of plugins / extensions / modules / libraries
    for existing services or coding languages available. So maybe you won't have to write your own
    code for integrating shipcloud into your system. Just have a look at
    <a href="https://www.shipcloud.io/en/integrations/plugins?utm_source=devportal">our
    integrations page</a> and see for yourself.

    You're developing for a platform that we're missing? Great! We're always looking for new partners
    who'd like to integrate us into their platform or the platform they're using. Feel free to contact
    us so we can put up links to your work on our sites once the integration is available.

          <strong>Notice</strong>:
          To make things easier for our support team we'd kindly ask you to send a custom header
          with every request you're making. This way we can identify problems with a specific
          platform easier. The headers key is <code>Affiliate-ID</code>. To know which value you
          need to specify, please contact us at developers@shipcloud.io.
