    Welcome
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-m">
    to the shipcloud developer portal where you - the developer - will hopefully get all the
    information you need to get started with integrating shipcloud into your own service, shop, app
    or other crazy idea.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-m">
    This is supposed to be your one stop for all developer needs. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there's anything missing in this portal, you've found a typo, bug or something isn't clear, the developer
    portal is build as a public repository on github. Feel free to fork it, change things, make a pull request or
    even run your own local version of it.
