# Examples

To give you a better understanding of how the shipcloud api could be used you can find a few
examples on this page. Sometimes there's also a certain chain of calls you need to perform to
achieve a specific goal.

## Additional services

Some services can be used on top of a normal shipment. Therefore they don't fall under the normal
definition of a service - and because they mostly are only available for a few carriers. We're
calling them _additional services_.


### Advance notice
Some carriers provide the option to notify the recipient of a shipment of its arrival date and /
or time. We currently support advance notices for DHL and DPD. While DHL supports notifications via
email DPD also allows the recipient to also be notified via SMS.

__Requirements:__

- ```language``` has to be provided as a
[ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

#### Notification via email

### DPD - Predict

DPD allows recipients to be notified of a pending delivery within the next hour. The so called

can be used with shipcloud by specifying it as an additional service. You can either specify the
email address or phone number of your customer to be notified.

For examples see [advance notice](#advance-notice)

## Label size
Not all carriers use the same size of labels. Have a look at our chart of the
[carrier specific label sizes]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/#carrier-specific-label-sizes)
we support.

You can configure the standard size we should create labels for each and every carrier from within
the shipcloud backoffice, so you won't have to think about handling different label sizes. You can
however define the size of the label on a per shipment basis. So, when you're creating a shipping
label via our api you can send us the size the shipping label should have.

{% highlight json %}
{
  "from": {
    // see [1]
  },
  "to": {
    // see [1]
  },
  "package": {
    // see [2]
  },

  "street": "Mittelweg",
  "street_no": "158a",

  "phone": null,
  "id": "10b10652-570b-4bc3-9e14-dab0b51b075f"

{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the response contains a unique id for this address, which you can use to create shipments

{% highlight http %}
POST /shipments
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight json %}
{
  "carrier":"DHL",
  "to": {
    "id": "10b10652-570b-4bc3-9e14-dab0b51b075f"

## pakadoo

pakadoo is a service that lets you receive personal packages at work. For this a so called pakadoo
point is being installed in your companies office rooms. For more information visit
[http://www.pakadoo.de](http://www.pakadoo.de)

There are 2 ways you can create a shipment that’s going to be send to a pakadoo point:  

- create an address and use the id that’s returned for the address to create a shipment  
- create a shipment by specifying the pakadoo ID in the to address object of the shipments call.

In both cases you can either specify the pakadoo ID as ```pakadoo_id``` or you simply use
the ```care_of``` attribute with "PAK" as a prefix to the pakadoo ID (e.g "PAK 5KQTPH5").

### Create a pakadoo address and shipment using the pakadoo_id

If the pakadoo user has been identified, shipcloud will return an address object, containing the
currently selected delivery address for said pakadoo user.

#### Create Address Request

{% highlight http %}
POST /addresses
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight json %}
{
  "pakadoo_id": "5KQTPH5"
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Create Address Response

{% highlight json %}
{
  "id": "71f2522f-be6f-4606-8eda-67997edfe2ac",
  "pakadoo_id": "5KQTPH5",
  "company": "LGI GmbH",
  "street": "Hewlett-Packard-Str.",
  "street_no": "1/1",
  "zip_code": "71083",
  "city": "Herrenberg",
  "country": "DE"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Like with every other address you can then use its unique address id to create a new shipment with it.

#### Create Shipment Request

{% highlight http %}
POST /shipments
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight json %}
{
  "from": {
    // see [1]
  }
  "to": {
    "id": "71f2522f-be6f-4606-8eda-67997edfe2ac"
  },
  "package": {
    // see [2]
  },
  "carrier": "dhl",
  "create_shipping_label": true,
  "metadata": {
    "pakadoo": {
      "shop_name": "The shopname",
      "order_number": "123456",
      "order_date": "2015-06-01",
      "e_mail_shop": "user@example.com",
      "order_total": {
        "amount": 42.12,
        "currency": "EUR"
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Create a shipment using the pakadoo ID in the care_of attribute

You can use this if e.g. you don't want to amend your checkout process. Your customers can use your
existing address form to specify the pakadoo point address by entering their pakadoo ID in the
```care_of``` field (e.g. "PAK 5KQTPH5").

We're checking the ```care_of``` attribue for the "PAK" prefix. If it's found, we then check
if a valid pakadoo userid is present, validate it using the pakadoo system and return the users'
selected pakadoo point address, if available.

___Notice:___
_Any additional "to" address information given in the request will be replaced by what is returned
from the pakadoo system._
