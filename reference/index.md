## Pickup requests

### Requesting pickup
There are two ways you can request shipments to be picked up by a specific carrier. By simply
stating that all shipments that haven't been picked up already should be picked up or by specifying
which shipments should by picked up.

__Notice:__ _If you don't supply a pickup_address in your request, we're using the default from
address that's being defined in the shipcloud profile for requesting a pickup by the carrier.
Please keep in mind there are
[carrier specific field lengths]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/#carrier-specific-field-lengths)
for that._

#### Request

Here's an example for having all shipments being picked up by a specific carrier:

{% include reference/pickup_requests_request_togglebox.html %}

<kbd>POST</kbd> __/v1/pickup_requests__

{% highlight json %}
{
  "carrier": "dpd",
  "pickup_time": {
    "earliest": "2015-09-15T09:00:00+02:00",
    "latest": "2015-09-15T18:00:00+02:00"
  },
  "pickup_address": {
    "company": "Muster-Company",
    "first_name": "Max",
    "last_name": "Mustermann",
    "street": "Musterstra√üe",
    "street_no": "42",
    "zip_code": "54321",
    "city": "Musterstadt",
    "country": "DE",
    "phone": "555-555"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to only have specific shipments be picked up you add the shipment ids to the call:

{% include pickup_post_requests_request.json %}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Response

__Notice:__ _Some carriers (e.g. Hermes) are using the address that's being defined at the carrier
account for picking up shipments. In those cases we'll return ```null``` as pickup_address._

{% highlight json %}
