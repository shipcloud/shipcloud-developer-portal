# Samples

For exemplary purposes we're using the pre generated sandbox api key ({{ site.apikey }}). You can use it for testing
our api, but be advised that we're deleting all data associated with this key once a day. So if you want to use your
test shipments from the day before it's best if you [create a free developer account](https://app.shipcloud.io/users/sign_up?plan=developer&cc=sc_docs_samples).
