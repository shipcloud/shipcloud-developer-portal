shipcloud.io devportal
======================

Need to know more about how shipcloud works from a developers standpoint? You've come to the right place!
This Jekyll based repository will aid you in understanding the ideas and concepts behind shipcloud.io and will also give
you a handy reference for using our api.

## Run locally

If you want to run our developer portal locally you can do it by following these simple steps:

```console
~ $ git clone git@github.com:shipcloud/shipcloud.github.io.git
~ $ cd shipcloud.github.io
~ $ bundle install
~/shipcloud.github.io $ jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

## Contributing

Our developer portal strives from participation. If you find anything that is not right our out of the ordinary, we've
added a link to the corresponding file on GitHub on almost every page (except this one). If you follow it, you can edit
the file directly on GitHub or you do it "the manual way" by cloning the repository and submitting pull requests.

If you don't have the time or find that something we've written isn't clear, you can also open an issue through GitHub
or send us an email at [developers@shipcloud.io](mailto:developers@shipcloud.io).

### What about feature requests?
We're constantly working on the shipcloud platform and our backlog is filled with lots of cool things. That doesn't
mean, that we've covered all bases. So if there's anything you absolutely need from shipcloud to be part of your use
case, feel free to send us an email at [developers@shipcloud.io](mailto:developers@shipcloud.io), describing what it is
that you need shipcloud to be doing. If you aren't a customer already, please also send us data on how many shipments
your platform or shop will be submitting. This way we can better prioritize feature requests.

_Please don't put feature requests into GitHub Issues._

### New platform or shop integrations
Because we simply don't have enough developers or the needed expertise to create integrations for every shop or
platform, we're more than happy to work with partners who know the ins and outs of a specific platform. If you want to
create a shipcloud plugin / extension / addon please contact us at [info@shipcloud.io](mailto:info@shipcloud.io) and
we'll find a way to work together.
